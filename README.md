# 🌱 Libft

> The project where everything started — my first dive into the world of C.

## 💡 About the Project
At **42 Madrid**, `libft` is the very first step in learning how to build your own library from the ground up.  
The challenge? Recreate key functions from the C standard library, without using any of them.

This project gave me my first real contact with:
- Memory allocation and pointer manipulation  
- Error handling at a low level  
- Structuring reusable and maintainable code

## ⚙️ What It Includes
A collection of C functions covering:
- Memory management  
- String operations  
- Character classification  
- Linked list utilities

## 🧠 Reflection
When I started, many parts of my code were admittedly “hard-coded” — but it marked the beginning of a journey of **steady improvement and deep understanding** of how C really works.

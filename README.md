#Libft Project - My First Project at 42
Welcome to my libft project!

##Description
At 42, the libft project serves as the first step into the world of C programming. For this project, I aimed to rewrite a set of basic functions from the C standard library, such as strlen, strcpy, malloc, free, among others.

##Motivation
This project represents my initial dive into C programming. Due to my lack of experience, I must confess that certain parts of the code are hard-coded due to my lack of experience at the time. Nonetheless, it was an invaluable opportunity to grasp the inner workings of these fundamental functions and begin to familiarize myself with essential concepts like pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

##Norm
In this project, you must follow the norm
